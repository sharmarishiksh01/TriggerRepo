# Notes:
# - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate scopes and add it to this repo's
#   Secrets as `REPO_TRIGGER_PAT`.
#   Recommended scopes: `repo` (or `public_repo` for a public repo) and `workflow` if present.
# - The target workflow must include `workflow_dispatch:` in its `on:` block to be triggerable.
